						Rosetta Stone is an educational software that is used to teach a variety of different languages. 
						I personally recall using Rosetta Stone to learn Spanish when I was in elementary school, back when I lived in New Jersey. 
						Rosetta Stone offered a variety of pronunciation exercises, as well as spelling and grammar games in addition to pictures that illustrated certain concepts. 
						One aspect that I truly loved about Rosetta Stone, was layout of the chapters, because important concepts in regards to learning the language were separated into unique chapters (such as colors, numbers, places etc.). 
						The most interesting thing to note about Rosetta Stone, is that students that wish to use this software for learning purposes, only need a keyboard, mouse, computer and a pair of headphones.

					<img src = "https://cdn.studentloanhero.com/wp-content/uploads/udemy-review-640x300.jpg">
					<aside class = "notes">
						Udemy is an online learning and teaching marketplace, and the website offers over 100,000 unique courses in fields ranging all the way from mathematics, to computer programming, to music. 
						Once students enroll in a course, they automatically receive lifetime access to the videos, documents, and practice questions that the instructor has uploaded. 
						In the summer of 2016, I took a course in “Amazon drop-shipping” (an e-commerce revenue strategy that is not offered as a course as of 2019, in most post-secondary institutions) and I can safely attest that I gained a lot of knowledge about areas of digital marketing, that I had never even known about in the past! 
						I believe in the future, websites like Udemy which offer specialized forms of knowledge, will continue to prosper.

					<h2 style = "color: white">Online Courses: An Anti-Social Future?</h2>
					<img src = "https://www.epicflow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/digital-transformation-courses-750x353.png">
					<aside class = "notes">
						After taking a closer look at the first slide, the main piece of technology that happens to be the center point of my presentation, is the machine that the teacher is crunching the papers into, and presumably, the knowledge from those papers is being transported to the ears of the students who sit in the classroom, completely oblivious to any form of human interaction. 
						If this is truly the future of education, then I must confess that it seems to be a rather sorrowful depiction. 
						However, this image also does raise some important questions: 
						With the rise of online courses and educational videos being readily available online, are we heading towards this kind of a future?

					<aside class = "notes">
						To put it quite simply: I think teachers are important. 
						Now I’ll admit, I have had my fair share of bad teachers, but in my honest opinion, I think teachers play an essential role in helping students achieve their highest potential. 
						Personally, I would much rather come to a “real-life classroom” as opposed to a “virtual classroom” if given the choice, because I find that I learn the most when I ask questions during class. 
						A teacher is an expert and they can truly help students understand concepts better, especially from one-on-one interactions, because they can easily pin point the learning areas in which the student is lacking clarity.
