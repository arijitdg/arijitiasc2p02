# IASC | ARIJIT DASGUPTA

# Bio

My name Is Arijit Dasgupta and I’m a third year major, enrolled in the Interactive Arts & Sciences program, minoring in Computer Science. This is officially my last semester at Brock, and I will be graduating in June. I’m so thrilled to finally start my career in digital marketing; being a student in the digital humanities department really helped get some hands-on experience in using various graphic design and web development related tools, and I am glad that I learned about the IASC program at Brock. Although my primary interest lies in both social media and affiliate marketing, in my years as an undergraduate student in IASC, my main area of specialization was data visualization. Two courses that really opened my eyes about data visualization were: IASC 1F01 & IASC 2P02. In both 1F01 and 2P02, I learned about a powerful online tool known as “Voyant”. Voyant is an open-source digital software that can be used to map the frequency of certain words, as well as discover areas of interest from a body of text. Voyant can be a highly useful tool for conducting surveys and learning about customer reviews based on their interactions with others, particularly from their choice of words.
