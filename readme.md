# IASC | ARIJIT DASGUPTA

# Bio

My name Is Arijit Dasgupta and I’m a third year major, enrolled in the Interactive Arts & Sciences program, minoring in Computer Science. This is officially my last semester at Brock, and I will be graduating in June. I’m so thrilled to finally start my career in digital marketing; being a student in the digital humanities department really helped get some hands-on experience in using various graphic design and web development related tools, and I am glad that I learned about the IASC program at Brock. Although my primary interest lies in both social media and affiliate marketing, in my years as an undergraduate student in IASC, my main area of specialization was data visualization. Two courses that really opened my eyes about data visualization were: IASC 1F01 & IASC 2P02. In both 1F01 and 2P02, I learned about a powerful online tool known as “Voyant”. Voyant is an open-source digital software that can be used to map the frequency of certain words, as well as discover areas of interest from a body of text. Voyant can be a highly useful tool for conducting surveys and learning about customer reviews based on their interactions with others, particularly from their choice of words.

# Featured Project: "The Future of Education" (Solo Presentation)

![](https://images.boredomfiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1-future.jpg)

For my solo research presentation, I decided to express my thoughts on a classic piece of art that was created by a French artist named, “Jean-Marc Côté”. The piece was titled, “The World In 100 years, From 1899” and immediately after looking at it, I began critically analyzing the current state of human and social interaction, in the twenty-first century. I was born in the December of 1995, so I practically grew up with the Internet throughout my childhood years; in other words, I genuinely cannot remember a time without the existence of the World Wide Web! Thanks to Tim Berners Lee (known as the “Grandfather of the World Wide Web”), I grew up in a world that is constantly hyperconnected, and I experienced the ability to gain access to all kinds of knowledge (videos, articles etc.) instantaneously, at the touch of my fingertips, since a very young age. After looking at Côté’s artistic piece, I started wondering, “is this truly what the world looks like right now?”. The most attention-drawing component of the artwork, is the teacher who happens to be churning textbooks and other papers into this machine, which is hypothetically meant to transfer the knowledge into the ears of the students who literally sit there in the classroom, void of any true human interaction. Now of course, the average college or high school does not look like this (at least as of 2019), but it is genuinely interesting to predict how the education system will be transformed in the next decade or two. Although this theoretical “textbook churning machine” is not real, headphones, smart phones, tablets, computers and the Internet is radically changing businesses and creating new industries (such as e-commerce and social media marketing) world wide.

After taking into consideration the feedback that was provided to me in regards to my presentation, I decided that there were some areas of my slides that needed improvement. Firstly, I felt that a very valid point was made from the feedback comments: Although I was talking about the “future of education”, I did not necessarily provide any concrete examples of technologies that illustrate the revolutionary changes technology can bring to the modern education system. Additionally, I was not specific about the piece of technology that was shown in Côté’s piece (the textbook churning machine). I would like to reiterate the fact that the summation of my entire presentation is a basically a logical prediction about what the future could look like. As such, the first change I made was explicitly talking about the churning machine on [Slide 3.](https://github.com/arijitdg/arijitiasc2p02/commit/e9693b5e96966f9e390778b8e71ffacceb4662fd) The second change I made, was talking about a piece of technology that directly correlates to the advancement of digital education, and so I decided to provide the example of Rosetta Stone, a language learning software, on [Slide 1.](https://github.com/arijitdg/arijitiasc2p02/commit/449c419160ff4aedb0bddeb88a37168a92980bcb) The third change I made, was talking about a breakthrough learning/teaching database known as Udemy, and I included this change on [Slide 2.](https://github.com/arijitdg/arijitiasc2p02/commit/751405165dfdd0d5d6356d4d77a710c452fd51f3) I also wanted to make it clear that even in the future, there will still be a considerable amount of real-life courses. In my personal opinion, although virtual courses will continue to increase, real-life courses (especially for fields of study that require hands-on experience, such as the environmental sciences or biomedical science) will still continue to flourish because they provide a high degree of educational value, as well as faster learnability for students. I decided to mention this point on [Slide 4.](https://github.com/arijitdg/arijitiasc2p02/commit/129ecf8e1ec480e4bf2f54574be7f397c37e1998) The final topic I felt necessary to add, was the ongoing issue of expensive textbook costs, which I feel will be counteracted (and made more affordable) as a result of online e-book platforms such as Amazon Kindle. I talk about this on [Slide 5.](https://github.com/arijitdg/arijitiasc2p02/commit/2192926fef425ea31ebdb2005fad42b960d9d5cf)

# Collaborative Project

The tool that our group presented about is called “Scalar”. Scalar is a unique text visualization tool that allows users to create beautifully crafted digital books, with extensive features that allow collaborative options, as well as tagging and organization setups that help authors create custom layouts for their books. In my opinion, I think Scalar is a powerful tool that could truly revolutionize the creation of digitally written bodies of work, especially since there is already a growing popularity for e-books. Platforms such as Amazon Kindle have managed to truly transform the novel industry, encouraging authors to publish their works at a very minimal cost online, so that they can push their books to virtual audiences worldwide.

My role in this project was to conduct the overview portion of the research, in order to provide the class with a basic summary of Scalar, as well as it’s potential uses. My first deliverable, was to understand the very fundamental component that Scalar uses to structure the program itself, the “Resource Distribution Framework”. The RDF (for short) is a very relevant concept in both computer science (mainly as arrays/linked lists), as well as online databases; basically the way it works, is as follows: For any given resource, in order to access and retrieve the descriptive assets regarding that particular resource, certain links must be created to the central database. For example, if there is an individual named “John Smith” on the database and I wanted to find John’s birthdate, I would need to create a link to access the part of the central server, which contains his birthdate. I talk about the RDF on [Slide 2.](https://github.com/IascAtBrock/IASC-2P02-TeamPresentations/blob/Team1/Overview/ArijitSlide2.md) My second deliverable was to talk about a handful of some of the most important features that Scalar has, such as the tagging functionality as well as collaborative options. One of the most essential qualities about Scalar (that separates it from other word processing programs such as Microsoft Word and Google Docs), is that it allows users to create entire sections and chapters based on the written content. Additionally, since it has extensive cloud options, multiple authors can work on a single book simultaneously, from any part of the world, at any given time! In my opinion, Scalar also tries to bridge the gap between readers and authors, because it allows the readers to post comments on pages. I talk about all of these things on [Slide 3.](https://github.com/IascAtBrock/IASC-2P02-TeamPresentations/blob/Team1/Overview/ArijitSlide3.md) My final deliverable, was to provide a little background history about how Scalar was funded; Scalar was funded by the Alliance for Networking Visual Culture (ANVC), and the current creative director of the ANVC is Erik Loyer. I talk about this brief history on [Slide 4.](https://github.com/IascAtBrock/IASC-2P02-TeamPresentations/blob/Team1/Overview/ArijitSlide4.md)
